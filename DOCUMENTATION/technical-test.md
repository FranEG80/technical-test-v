# ðŸ§ª Technical Test

## Create a simple editor using [tldraw](https://tldraw.com/)

---

## Technologies Used
- [Next.js (React)](https://nextjs.org/docs)  
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)  
- [Shadcn ](https://ui.shadcn.com/) (a utility-first CSS framework) 
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) (@trpc/server & @trpc/client)  
- [Tldraw](https://tldraw.com/)  

---

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Editor page.  
2. There must be an API endpoint that allows the app to retrieve store data.  
3. After any change the store should be updated.  
   - Add a button that modifies a shape.  
4. Utilize Next.js' built-in API routes to handle server-side operations.  
5. Use TailwindCSS for styling the application with the help of Shadcn for UI interfaces consistent with design requirements.  
6. Implement tRPC to facilitate type-safe API calls between the client and server.  

---

### Technical Requirements
- Create a Next.js application from scratch.  
- Set up TailwindCSS with Next.js and integrate Shadcn components where appropriate.  
- Construct tRPC API routes within the Next.js app which expose at least two endpoints:  
  - One endpoint to retrieve the document data.  
  - Another endpoint to store the data.  
- Use Next.js app routing to navigate between pages and components.  
- Implement error handling and loading states for API calls.  
- Write simple documentation in a `README.md` file, explaining how to set up and run the application locally.  

---

## Bonus Points
- Implement additional features using AI.  
- Good design.  

---

## Expected Deliverables

### Minimum Deliverables
- A repository with a Next.js application that meets the functional requirements.  
- A `README.md` file describing the setup instructions, how to run the app, and how to test the API calls.  

---

## Evaluation Criteria
- Code quality and readability.  
- Proper use of React and Next.js features (e.g., server-side rendering, data fetching).  
- Component design and reusability.  
- Styling accuracy and use of TailwindCSS classes.  
- Effective use of tRPC for type-safe APIs.  
- Ease of setup and completeness of documentation.
